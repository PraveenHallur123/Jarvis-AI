## **Features**

- Greet the user with "Hello".
- Tell the current time.
- Open websites like YouTube and Google.
- Play music from YouTube.
- Search Wikipedia (opens the Wikipedia page in a new tab).

## **How to Use**

1. Clone or download the project files to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Type a command in the input box and press "Send" or hit Enter.
